# Coaster studio
This is the software I made for my [software video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fMpfSGNF6U)

It's a basic 2D animation software, coded in JS. It's still a wip.

## How to use it
There is an online version [here](https://studio.ekrcoaster.net) but you can also hit the download button and open up the `index.html` file in your browser.
